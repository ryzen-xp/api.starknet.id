## Features

- Identity resolution and management
- Domain name services
- Secure API endpoints
- Docker containerization support
- Rust-powered performance

## Prerequisites

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/api.starknet.id.git
cd api.starknet.id
```

3. Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b fix-[issue-number]
```

4. Build the project:

- Server settings
- Database connections
- StarkNet node configuration
- Logging preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Build Fails**
   - Ensure Docker is running
   - Check if required ports are available
